# My Tide Dataset 
This contains the data that I used for the completion of my senior thesis at Haverford College in the 2020-2021 school year.

I sourced this data for free from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I used the data to fit a seasonal ARIMA model using time series analysis!

If you want to read my thesis, then email me at jvanwigger@haverford.edu for it, I'd be happy to share it.
